    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>Belgian waffles are a variety of waffle with a lighter batter, larger squares, and deeper pockets than American waffles. Belgian waffles were originally leavened with yeast, but baking powder is now often used. They are often eaten as a breakfast food; toppings vary from whipped cream, confectioners sugar, soft fruit, and chocolate spread, to syrup and butter or margarine. They may also be served with vanilla ice cream and fresh fruit (such as strawberries) as a dessert.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon baking soda</li>

      <li>¼ cup butter</li>
      <li>⅔ cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons rum flavored extract</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
