    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>A classic dish in Cajun culture, crawfish étouffée is the perfect way to wind down crawfish season or entertain a large group without getting the boiling equipment out. And, as long as you have the time to let it cook properly, it’s a fairly easy dish that’s sure to impress.

      At Acadia Crawfish, we love this classic crawfish étouffée recipe for how quickly it all comes together. With a little bit of love (and a Cajun’s best friend: The Cajun Trinity), you’ll have an étouffée that’ll give you a nod of approval from even the most old-school grandmére. It’s a dish that’s served at a lot of family gatherings in South Louisiana, and typically makes an appearance towards the end of the season or after a boil, as it’s a great way to use up any leftover crawfish. If you don’t have leftovers, don’t worry; our packages of tails are fully seasoned and packed with flavor that perfectly complement the rest of the ingredients.</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>½ stick of unsalted butter (¼ cup)</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 small white onion, chopped (approx. 1 cup)</li>
        <li>½ cup green bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup celery hearts, chopped</li>
        <li>2tsp. minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken stock/broth (can substitute seafood stock)</li>
        <li>1tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly cracked black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>½tsp Cajun Bayou Blends seasoning</li>
        <li>1lb. Acadia Crawfish crawfish tails</li>
        <li>1tbsp. chopped fresh parsley, plus extra for garnish</li>
        <li>¼ cup sliced green onion, plus extra for garnish</li>
        <li>Medium-Grain White Rice, for serving</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Chop the onion, green bell pepper and celery (The Cajun Trinity); parsley and green onions; then mince garlic. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Make a roux by melting butter in a large skillet over medium heat and stirring in the flour; cook and stir constantly (this is important otherwise your flour might burn) until caramel colored (about 4-5 minutes).</li>
        <li>Add the onion, bell pepper and celery; cook until soft but not translucent (about 3-4 minutes). Then, add the garlic and cook until fragrant (about 1 minute).</li>
        <li>Slowly stir in the stock or broth until fully incorporated. Add salt, pepper and Cajun Bayou Blends seasoning.</li>
        <li>Bring mixture to a boil; reduce heat to a medium-low simmer, cover and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add the crawfish tails, cook and stir until crawfish is heated through; stir in parsley and green onion, reserving a bit for garnish.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately over freshly cooked rice.</li>
      </ol>
